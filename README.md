# TTT

Tic-Tac-Toe is a childhood classic game that can be played anywhere, even with just dirt and a stick. 

You create a grid consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns, amounting to 9 boxes. 

Each person (2 people) are assigned either an "X" or an "O", in this game I have assigned each person an NFL Team Helmet. (I mean come on it's football season!)

First player is the Giants and second player is the Patriots. 

First player clicks a box(shaped like a football helmet) and then it is automated to tell you when it is the second players turn. 

If you get all three of your helmets in either a row or diagnal, YOU WIN!.
